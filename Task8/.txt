Goal
Build an Excel-like virtual grid entirely rendered on <canvas>, supporting interaction and inline editing using overlaid HTML elements, handling 100,000 rows × 500 columns efficiently.

🧠 Key Concepts to Study & Design Map
Here’s an updated and focused study and implementation breakdown:

🔳 1. Canvas-Only Grid Rendering
🎯 Concepts to Study:
CanvasRenderingContext2D methods:

fillRect, strokeRect, fillText, measureText

canvas.width / canvas.height control

Coordinate transforms (ctx.translate, ctx.save, ctx.restore)

Viewport math: scroll offset, visible rows/columns

🧱 Structure:
Define fixed rowHeight and columnWidths[]

On scroll: calculate which cells are visible

Only draw visible cell boundaries + labels + content

🔧 Optimization Tactics:
Dirty Rendering: Only repaint if needed

Double Buffering: Use an offscreen canvas to draw, then copy to main canvas

Virtualization:

Use scrollTop, scrollLeft to compute:

ini
Copy
Edit
visibleRowStart = Math.floor(scrollTop / rowHeight)
visibleRowEnd = visibleRowStart + viewportRowCount
Same for columns

🧩 2. Component/Subsystem Design
🔳 Grid class
Orchestrator for all drawing and interaction

Handles:

Scroll

Resizing

Delegating events

Calling render

🔳 Renderer class
Handles drawing all elements on canvas

Cell borders

Cell contents

Selected cells

Headers

🔳 Cell, Row, Column classes
Store metadata like dimensions, style, dataIndex

🔳 GridDataModel
Holds actual data

Map of data[row][col] (sparse or flat map preferred)

Generate 50,000+ records and parse into this model

🔳 SelectionManager
Stores current selected cell(s), row(s), column(s)

Handles drag-to-select logic

Draws selected areas using Renderer

🔳 CellEditor
Creates & manages a floating HTML <input>

On double-click or Enter

Sync with canvas position

Commit on blur/Enter

Study DOM positioning:

Use canvas.getBoundingClientRect() for offset

Map cell coordinates to canvas position

🎮 3. User Interaction Layer
✍️ Cell Editing
Mouse click → detect which cell

Place HTML <input> at the cell's screen position

On commit, trigger:

js
Copy
Edit
EditCommand(cell, oldValue, newValue)
🎯 Resizing (Rows/Columns)
Mouse movement detects edge (hover state)

On mousedown + drag:

Show resize feedback line

Adjust rowHeight[] or columnWidths[]

Trigger re-render

🔲 Selection + Range Selection
Mouse drag selects:

Single cell

Whole row/column

Rectangular range

Support Shift+click and Ctrl+click logic

Compute stats (min, max, avg, sum) on selected range

🌀 4. Command Pattern for Actions
✨ Study This Pattern
Encapsulates every user action as an object with execute() and undo()

Command Type	Triggers
EditCommand	Cell edit
ResizeCommand	Resize column/row
SelectCommand	Selection change

🎛️ CommandManager
Holds stack of commands

Supports undo() and redo() methods

🧠 5. Data Loading (JSON Model)
⚙️ Features:
Load JSON array like:

json
Copy
Edit
{ id: 1, firstName: "Raj", lastName: "Solanki", age: 30 }
Map keys to columns (i.e. dynamic column headers)

Allow column headers to be inferred from keys

Generate mock data:

Use a script to generate 50,000–100,000 records

Randomized values

🔍 Summary of What to Study
Concept	Purpose
Canvas API	Low-level rendering
Coordinate math	Virtual scrolling, hit-testing
Virtualization logic	Large datasets rendering
HTML overlay syncing	Cell editing with inputs
Command Pattern	Undo/redo actions
Selection logic	Cell ranges, stats
Sparse data structure	Efficient memory usage
Mouse/keyboard event handling	UI interactions
Object-oriented design	Code organization

🚀 Suggested Learning/Study Sequence
HTML Canvas Basics – 2D drawing, coordinates, clipping

Grid Virtualization – Calculate visible rows/cols based on scroll

OOP Design – Classes for grid, data, render, editor

Event Handling – Clicks, drags, resizing

Command Pattern – Implement undo/redo infrastructure

JSON Handling + Data Models – Generate large datasets

Overlay Editing – Place input fields on canvas cells

Selection Range Stats – Compute count, sum, etc
